-- How to use the program:
-- Write main in the terminal and have the text file with Sudoku strings ready in your directory.
-- Please change the name to the file in the main function where the marker is.
-- When main is typed in you will se the current Sudoku Board out of 50 in the terminal and
-- four choices where you must type in 1, 2, 3 or 4..
-- 1. Which will solve the current Sudoku and print it out for you and go back to the four
--    choices, one Sudoku Board is gone now because it has been used.
-- 2. Solves all the Sudoku Boards that is left, prints out every solution in the terminal.
--    Please note that you cant interrupt the second option if you activate it. Once all Sudoku
--    Boards are used, the program will shut down. NOTE THAT THIS CAN TAKE VERY LONG TIME!
-- 3. The user will assign a value to a square and will get feedback if this can be done or not.
--    The program will then take you back to the four options and you can choose to keep on trying
--    to solve the current board or just solve it or every board left.
-- 4. This option exits the program.
--
-- Once all Sudoku Boards have been solved/used the program will shut down.

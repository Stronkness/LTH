3. 3 clock cycles per iteration
9. 
   a:
   50th clock cycle as it begins after the five dots, Iop id 707.
   Last iteration at clock cycle 340. (340-50)/100 = 2.9 clock cycles per iteration

   b:
   50th clock cycle. Iop id 704.
   Last iteration at clock cycle 651. (651-50)/100 = 6.01 clock cycles per iteration
10. fmadd - it states that source is not ready, it has to wait for other operations to be done, the red signs indicate wait time
12. stw - Store, std - Store Double Word, stwcx - Store Word Conditional Index
    Too many store operations, there are not enough resources to write to store all the time.
    Hence the waiting. some bc (Branch Conditional) were also quite large and waited some

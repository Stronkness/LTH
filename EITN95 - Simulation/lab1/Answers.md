As we have a lower arrival time but still a a service time to handle this we get a higher mean number of customers in the system than if we have a higher time of arrival. Which makes sense.

***e***
| Simulation time | Mean number of customers |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 5000            | 0.6647                   |
| 10000           | 0.661                    |
| 20000           | 0.6649                   |

As the E(arrival time) is 0.8 and we have a service time which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 we have a stable system to serve these customers and no buffer will be overloaded and go to infinite. Hence why the simulation time won't matter.

**Task 2**
***a***
Seems like it has 1 server

***b***
Between 0 and 0.2, which is a maximum of 1/0.2 = 5 customers per timeunit

***c***
Between 0 and 0.2 in a uniformly distribution, which is also maximum 5 per timeunit

***d***


***e***
